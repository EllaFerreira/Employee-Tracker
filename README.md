## About this Project

As a developer frequently we have to create interfaces that allows non-developers to easily interact with information stored in databases.

In this project I used MySQL as datasabe and Inquirer npm package to be able to interact with the user via command-line, and the console.table npm package to print MySQL rows to the console.
